	abstract = {Abstract The basic Procrustes problem is to transform a matrix to in order to match a target matrix . Matching necessitates that and have the same number of rows identified with the same entities but the columns are unrestricted in type and number. Special cases discussed are when T is an orthogonal, projection, or direction-cosine matrix. Sometimes, both matrices are transformed and size parameters referring to isotropic and various forms of anisotropic scaling may be incorporated. Procrustes methods may be generalized to cover K transformed matrices , in which case their average (the group average) is important. Applications are in shape analysis, image analysis, psychometrics etc. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Abstract We propose a method for calculating deformations of models by deforming a low-resolution mesh and adding details while ensuring that the details we add satisfy a set of constraints. Our method builds a low-resolution representation of a mesh by using edge collapses and performs an as-rigid-as-possible deformation on the simplified mesh. We then add back details by reversing edge-collapses so that the shape of the mesh is locally preserved. While adding details, we deform the mesh to match the predicted positions of constraints so that constraints on the full-resolution mesh are met. Our method operates on meshes with arbitrary triangulations, satisfies constraints over the full-resolution mesh and converges quickly.},
